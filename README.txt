NPCGenerator a tool used by Game Masters (GMs) to be able to quickly
create Non-Player Characters (NPCs) to populate their world. This
generate gives a basic enough description of the character to be
able to quickly gain an idea of this character and be able to
easily build off of the given description. This is a command line
program that has the following capabilities.

can be done.

write (fileName)
Saves the character to the computers drive. A filename can be
included or can be defaulted to the characters first name.

load (fileName)

filename.

Currently this program will generate the characters race, name,
age, height, weight, hair style and color and eye color.

From here, the next steps are to generate a dominate feature,
social class and general backstory.
